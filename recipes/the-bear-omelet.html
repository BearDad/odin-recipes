    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I was attempting to achieve a crispy, inside-out Parmesan omelet — and it
      worked! The caramelized cheese formed a thin but protective layer and,
      since the eggs had never directly touched the pan, they were moist and
      tender. This will also work whether you use one or three eggs, depending
      on the texture you're going for. Using a single egg is kind of a cool
      trick, since the cheese layer is almost as thick, and you can really
      appreciate the crispness even more.

    <h2>Ingredients.</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>2 eggs</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>¼ teaspoon water</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>1 teaspoon olive oil</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          1 ounce freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or a little less
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>1 pinch cayenne pepper</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps.</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Crack eggs into a mixing bowl. Add 1/4 teaspoon water. Whisk together
          until just beaten (do not overmix).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Drizzle olive oil into an 8-inch nonstick skillet. Brush evenly over
          the bottom of the pan. Evenly grate cheese into the skillet
          approximately 1/2-inch deep (or just shy of 1 ounce).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Place pan over medium-high heat. Cheese will slowly start to melt.
          When cheese starts to bubble and turn golden brown, about 4 minutes,
          pour eggs evenly over cheese. Reduce heat to low. Sprinkle with salt,
          pepper, and cayenne. Cover and let eggs cook on low until they are
          set, checking after the first 30 seconds. For 2 eggs, this should take
          about 1 minute, total cooking time.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Remove pan from heat. Carefully use a spatula to fold parmalet in
          half. Transfer to a serving plate.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
